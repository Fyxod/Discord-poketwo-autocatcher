# Discord-poketwo-autocatcher
I suggest it to be imported to replit and run there 
You can fork from here: https://replit.com/@ParthKatiyar1/third-catch-2#readme.md

In case you don't know- If it asks for language select python and in the run section write "Python main.py"

This is an autocatcher for Poketwo bot on Discord

How to setup:
go to main.py
step 1: put your token where it says TOKEN = "your token here"
step 2: put your channel id where it says cid = "PUT CHANNEL ID HERE" for example cid = 821148660922187846
step3: run it
HOW TO KEEP IT RUNNING AFTER CLOSING THE TAB:
make an account on https://uptimerobot.com
create a https monitor
paste the url that appears on the right after you run it there should be something like https://catcher-free.zhongli2.repl.co

commands:
.say <message> control the bot from another account
.catchrate calculate your catchrate
